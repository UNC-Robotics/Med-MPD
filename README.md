# Overview

This repository contains environments for evaluating motion planners and minimally-invasive robot designs.

## Data

### Lungs :lungs:

There are five lungs environments from the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative [(LIDC-IDRI)][2](CC-BY 3.0) image collection from The Cancer Imaging Archive [(TCIA)][2]. The bronchial tree, pleural boundary, and major vessels were segmented using an automatic segmentation algorithm [(LINK)][3], and the nodules and lung fissures were manually segmented using [3D-Slicer][4].

### Liver

There are five lungs environments from the Hepatocellular Carcinoma Transarterial Chemoembolization Segmentation [(HCC-TACE-Seg)][2](CC-BY 4.0) image collection from The Cancer Imaging Archive [(TCIA)][2]. Segmentations of the liver, cancer nodules, and blood vessels are provided as part of the data. These segmentations were manually refined using using [3D-Slicer][3] and the vessels were segmented into the hepatic arteries, hepatic veins, and portal vein.
