# Overview

This repository contains environments for evaluating motion planners and minimally-invasive robot designs.

## Data

### Lungs :lungs:

There are five lungs environments from the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative ([LIDC-IDRI][1]) (CC-BY 3.0) image collection from The Cancer Imaging Archive ([TCIA][2]). We segmented the bronchial tree, pleural boundary, and major vessels using an automatic segmentation algorithm ([LINK][3]), and we segmented the nodules and lung fissures manually using [3D-Slicer][4].

### Liver

There are five lungs environments from the Hepatocellular Carcinoma Transarterial Chemoembolization Segmentation ([HCC-TACE-Seg][5]) (CC-BY 4.0) image collection from The Cancer Imaging Archive ([TCIA][2]). Segmentations of the liver, cancer nodules, and blood vessels are provided as part of the data. We manually refined and expanded these segmentations using [3D-Slicer][4], as well as differentiated the vessels into the hepatic arteries, hepatic veins, and portal vein.
