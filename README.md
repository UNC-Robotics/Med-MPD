There are five lungs environments derived from the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative [(LIDC-IDRI)][2](CC-BY 3.0) image collection from The Cancer Imaging Archive [(TCIA)][2]. The bronchial tree, pleural boundary, and major vessels were segmented using an automatic segmentation algorithm [(LINK)][3], and the nodules and lung fissures were manually segmented using [3D-Slicer][4].
